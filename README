Really small and simple game developed using Action Script 3 and the flixel
library(http://www.flixel.org/). Unfortunately the code is not small and simple.

To compile it you must install the Flex SDK
(https://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html).

It works fine with the version 4.5.1.

To compile it just type:
mxmlc Darkness.as
It should create a file called Darkness.swf which can be executed in the browser
or using the flashplayer.

I personally use the fcsh to compile. Just type fcsh and in the console type
mxmlc Darkness.as
It will compile the game and show a message like:
"fcsh: Assigned 1 as the compile target id"
Then if you want to compile again just type:
compile 1
It's faster to compile this way.

Any doubts just contact me.
